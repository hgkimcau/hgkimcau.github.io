  <p>
    I am an Associate Professor at Graduate School of Advanced Imaging Science, Multimedia & Films (GSAIM), Chung-Ang University, where I am leading Immersive Reality & Integrated Systems Lab (IRIS LAB).
  </p>
  <p>
    Before joining Chung-Ang University, I was a postdoctoral researcher in School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC) and in Electrical Engineering (LTS4) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland.
    I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in School of Electronic Engineering at Inha University, Incheon, Korea, in 2012 and 2014, respectively. I received the Ph.D. degree in School of Electrical Engineering at KAIST, Daejeon, Korea, in 2019.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interests include Human-centered AI (HCAI) and Immersive content generation for 3D/AR/VR/Metaverse, particularly Convergence of AI & Reality.
